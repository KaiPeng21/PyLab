    "The Python **Global Interpreter Lock** or **GIL**, in simple words, is a lock that allows only one thread to take control of the python interpreter in CPython. This lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe (Not the case for IronPython or Jython, the .NET and Java implementation for Python). GIL is infamous for affecting multi-threaded programming in Python. But it is a myths to claim that the Python threading class is useless or it only slow down the execution time. In some circumstances, Python threading does speed up the process. Here we are going to look at how to properly handle threading in Python."
